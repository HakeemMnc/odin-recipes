    <h2>Easy Authentic Mexican Rice</h2>
    <p1
      >This easy Mexican rice recipe is cooked with onion powder, garlic powder,
      and tomato sauce for a simple side dish. Add green bell pepper, red bell
      pepper, or fresh tomato to the rice before simmering for extra flavor and
      color, according to your family's taste. Use chicken stock in place of
      water for even more savory flavor.
